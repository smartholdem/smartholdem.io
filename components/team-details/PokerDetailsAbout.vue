              <p>
                Blockchain Poker Club is a new Web3 poker platform that uses blockchain technology to guarantee game
                transparency and security.
              </p>
              <p>
                Blockchain Poker Club automates processes using blockchain, TRNG SmartHoldem, and cryptographic
                functions. Unlike traditional poker sites, it does not require trust in any server and a central
                authority to manage transactions and game outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thanks to blockchain technology, every Texas Hold'em game is recorded immutably and transparently.

              <h3 class="team__details-about-title">The Advantages of Web3 Blockchain Poker</h3>
              <p>
                Web3 Blockchain Poker offers many advantages over traditional poker sites, including:
              </p>
              <h3 class="team__details-about-title">No Rake</h3>
              <p>
                The decentralized Blockchain Poker Club does not charge a rake due to the absence of staff support
                costs, server fees, or other overhead costs. This fully automated blockchain platform is designed by
                players for players. Instead of rake, a blockchain fee of 1 STH (1STH = 1 chip) is charged from the bank
                for each poker hand. At Blockchain Poker Club, Poker is owned by the Players, unlike traditional poker
                sites that often charge high rake, typically ranging from 2.5% to 10% of the pot for each poker hand.

              </p>
              <h3 class="team__details-about-title">True crypto ownership </h3>

              <p>
                The development of truly decentralized poker took several years. We conducted several beta tests, and we
                tried to consider all the participants' wishes. We are currently completing several important stages in
                deploying the platform on the blockchain, namely connecting tournament creation modules, integrating the
                updated SmartHoldem API, and adding a cryptocurrency exchange function to the game wallet.
